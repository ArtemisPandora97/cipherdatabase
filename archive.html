<b> Cipher: What is the purpose of a world with fairies? </b><br><br>

Response: A world with fairies acts as a limiting factor to supernatural entity existance, and allows for there to be a unbias medium between wizards, humans, and other magicial creatures. 

<br><br>

<b> Cipher: What is the purpose of the Book of Tongues? </b><br><br>

The purpose of the book of tongues is to understand the mind, ciphers, plans and desires of supernatural entities who are under the umbrella of 'winged magical entity' including demons. 

<i> Please reference "Artemis Fowl" page on homepage. </i><br><br>

ArtemisLReed: Artemis Fowl is an interesting story because of the development Artemis has throughout the story. It is important to take care to examine his thoughts, feelings, and emotion as he interacts with the other characters. His self-awareness should be examined, and a thought journal produced that explains the importance of how what he thinks leds to how he acts.

<b>Cipher: What is the reason Butler is so important to Artemis's success?</b>

<br><br>

Butler is important for Artemis's success because he allows for Artemis to use his intellegence without discrimination and assist him in every means to making sure his plans are successful. 

<br><br>

<b>Postulate: In Harry Potter [Book One], we find that Harry has a deep desire to understand his past. How does this effect his ability to understand the fact that he is a wizard later? </b>

<br><br>

The simple answer to this question is the importance of dreams. How much importance does wizards put in the divination of dreams should be instrinstic and cultural. Upon recognizing the patterns of his life, his desire to know more shows inquistiveness which leads to belief later on when Hagrid meets him.
