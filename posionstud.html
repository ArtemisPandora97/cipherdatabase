<br><br>

One concept that often comes to mind when dealing with fear is understanding the Mind of the person who is initating the fear in the first place. It may seem as though we often focus on the one who is afraid, but when we know what the person, thing, or idea that is causing the fear, we may be able to deliver ourselves from the fear appropiately by understanding the purpose of the fear both on a universe, individual, and 'time' platform.

How does the distance between the object-magic-user relate to the ability for magic to be performed in a specific amount of time? How does fear effect this this?
