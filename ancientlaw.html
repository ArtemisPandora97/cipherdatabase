    <b> Cipher: Why are our works required when deliberating on our existence, and how can they be developed to produce motion or time when in need of wisdom? </b>

    <br><br>

    Deliberating on our existance can be translated as recognizing our 'councious' which allows us to develop our ability to align with God's wisdom, and therefore understand Self. This understanding of self produces destiny, and destiny accelerates works that are within the degrees of thier wisdom.

    [Student Submission] - What is the purpose of law? And how can it be developed into something more extensive then simply creating policies and punishments? 

    <br><br>

    <b> First Stage [1st Degree Rough draft] </b>

    <br><br>

    The purpose of law to is allow us to strengthen our relationships with others, and develop inner strength that allows us to live in harmony with one another. Policies allow us to test out laws, and laws allow for us to fairly deal reward and punishment in the case of dispute.
