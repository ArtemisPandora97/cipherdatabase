<center><b>Lesson One </b></center>

<br><br>

Large scale operations do not require people. Never does a large scale operation require people. Instead, it requires ideas that propel the operation's goals forward. Why is this important to understand? It is because people make the wrong assumption that if they have people, they have power. If they have power, they have success and time to complete whatever goals they wish to attain. There is a persistant wrong assumption that one can trick time into giving them more answers then they desire by building a pyramid of desires. This is an incorrect view. Time does not favor the wealthy nor the passoniate. It favors the wise. 

<br><br>

Let us begin this lesson by first defining wise. Wise is anyone who has the knowledge of the purpose of their existance. When developing oneself, it is important to recognize that God does not exist to everyone, but time does. This catch 20-20 is not hard to understand, yet we must remember that God exist. 

<br><br>

Let's say we can travel through time, and during the time we are traveling we find ourselves lost. How would this change if there are other people with us? The example would be fitting in a rent situation. If you are renting with more than one person, you split the bill and it is slightly less than if you were alone. Yet, the bill is still a bill. Similiarly, working with other people allows for you to get more done with less resources, but it is not power. It is not motivation. It is not absolute. That is because every human is equal and has the potential to exist without your help. 

<br><br>

So let's back to our topic which is large scale operations. The most important thing to remember is not who the operation's personnel are, but rather what personnel are required to complete a task or goal. 

<br><br>

<B>PROMPT:</B> How often do you consider the idea that you have a goal in mind but are not sure how many people are required to build that goal? 

<br><br>

ANS: <i>I believe that my main goal is to build a world that I can live in in peace, and find myself existing in a sphere of mystery and wisdom/knowledge. </i>

<br><br>

How often does one consider their ideas to be ridiculous or liable to create hardship? How often do we give up on our imagination because there are people who tell us not to think ourselves? If our time was theirs, who gave them permission to take our perspective as their own? This is slavery, and illegal in the eyes of man and God. We are a free people, and therefore we have the right to question, deliberate, and believe in whatever we so choose as long as we are not harming anyone. How does this relate to operations that are large-scale? It is because sometimes the concept of a large scale operation scares people away. They believe that as long as they stay away from what scares them, they can avoid the consequences of their own intellect. This is not true. Intellect was given to us for a reason, and all things will be revealed at some point.
