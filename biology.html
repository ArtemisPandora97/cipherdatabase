<b> Postulate: Why is biology the study of the logic of life and its functions? Define functions both scientifically and mathematically — true or false? </b>

<br><br>

A biology book is required to understand the importance of biology to understanding the logic of life and how it is divided into functions that seperate it from death or non-motion.

<u>Goals of Uncertainty</u>: Life is chaotic, and therefore must be understood logically so as to understand why the uncertainty exist.

<b> Postulate: Why can biology be the study of the chaos of life and its functions in a logical format? Define life functions both scientifically and mathematically — true or false? </b>

Note: As we study the depth of creation, it is important to find books that detail the philosophy of creation, and the ethics of understanding the concept of creating life as humans and how that relates to God.

Why is astronomy important? The book on the outline of History by H. G. Wells makes mention of the solar system before <u> explaining how the creation of humanity took place. </u> The Bible should be used as a reference for Astronomy, and the history of mankind up until it delivers us to history.

<b>Postulate: Social, economic, and political spheres require understanding of purpose, direction, and intent towards creation and motion, also known as time, in order to be developed perfectly. </b>

What is the origin of life? 

In theory, Kronologist believe that the origin of life begins with the Mind of God in triple darkness. With the accumalation of intent, direction, and motion "universe" was produced and from this came "life". "Life" is defined as anything that can perform life functions, and therefore has motion. The relative term being 'perform' and not 'mimic'.
