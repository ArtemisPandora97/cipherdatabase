    According to Kronology, intelligence is gained through using one's wisdom to produce 'time'. Wisdom is a generic term which means, "the ability to ascertain through works of the mind, clearly".

    <br><br>

    "Clearly" can mean many things including the ability to make distinctions, creating purpose, having intent, or accepting choices made.
