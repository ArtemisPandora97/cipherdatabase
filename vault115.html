    The purpose of this particular vault is to list some information regarding the understanding of the creation of the universe, it's importance to humanity, and the Mind of God. This vault is not to be defined until a cypheric has been produced. 

    <br><br>

    <i><center> The Origin of Time </center></i>

    <br><br>

    In the beginning, God created the heavens and the Earth, and the Earth was without form, and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep. The first <i> thought journal within Kronology </i> that will be examined is as follows:

    <br><br>

    God lived in heaven, and the Earth was a concept within his mind that he understood the creation of, but had not exacted it's form. The void was the emptiness of space, and darkness was the plan that had not yet been executed in the depth of his mind. The thought he had for this world produced an idea that one should study his creation in order to produce works that guide them through the hardships of 'life' which is defined as the ability to be measured by your existence. [Rough Draft]

    <br><br><br>

    <i><center> Theories of Kronology [Student Submissions] </center></i>

    <br><br>

    God exist in order to prove the measurement and value of his purpose, and to therefore create according to his Plan which was produced in triple darkness. 

    <br><br><br>

    <b><center> Time and Motion </center></b>

    <br><br>

    God created the Earth, and it was without form and there was darkness on it's face - meaning the sun had not produced enough light to reach Earth. 

    <br><br>

    <i>Add Requirement:</i> Understanding the Origins of light

    <br><br>

    The persistance in the desire to understand life comes from the understanding that philosophy brings theory, and from theory we can develop ourselves and examine, with wisdom, our knowledge so as to gain understanding. 

    <br><br>

    <i>Add Requirement:</i> Socrates and other Philosophers

    <br><br>

    Why does God exist is another question that this vault must answer for it is an urgent question for the proper evolution of humanity. One who uses wisdom should be able to decipher a relationship between us and God that dictates a reason for our existence in the first place. One who reasons or studies God must realize that we are apart of his universe with purpose, intent, and motion, and therefore have Works that must be performed in order to develop 'evolution'.

    <br><br>

    <center><b>Polytheism</b></center>

    <br><br>

    Polytheism must also be studied in order to allow for us to understand why people realized there is a higher intelligence in the world above them. Understanding how humanity reasons through their existence is a 'thought jounral' that must be contemplated futhur.
