    <b> - END OF WORKSHEET - </b>

    <br><br><br>

Those who are wealthy understand that they became wealthy to accomplish a specific goal or desire. Why? Because it is the currency that they must barter to attain their goals, wishes, or desires. 

<br><br>

Explain to yourself what wealth means to you. Many people will find that they do not need wealth for it will not bring them purpose. What they actually need is a job to keep them busy, family to keep them preoccupied, and friends to get them into trouble so they have a story to tell themselves and others when time passes. People who are wealthy will find that without purpose, their life is very boring and without meaning or desire unless they have intent and purpose towards what they are bartering their currency with. 

<br><br>

Why must one understand the purpose of currency first before developing their personal wealth management? It is becauase intent and purpose will motivate them not just to earn the money, but to keep earning it and therefore secure their family wealth management.
