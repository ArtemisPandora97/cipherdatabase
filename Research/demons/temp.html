    <b> Research Tasklist:</b>

    <ol>
        <li> What are elements that cause a decrease in temperature?  </li>
        <li> What are the properties of a demon's genetic information and how can this be crystallized in the form of cells inside of a cold water molecule? Is this format productive? Why or why not? </li>
        <li> What is the science of fast temperature changes, and how does this effect the creation of demons? </li>
        <li> Understand hormone genetics and how they effect personality. </li>
        <li> How does temperature relate to light, and why are both required for demon apparitions? </li>
        <li> What chemistry works against the formation of a demon through wator vapor? Why? </li>
        
    </ol>
