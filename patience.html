    There is no God besides God, and there is nothing like unto him for God is the orginator of the heavens and Earth, and we worship him.

    <b> Cipher: Why is a belief in God required for one who once to develop their patience according to Kronology? </b><br><br>

    Time brings wisdom when undertaking study, therefore one who believes in the innate plan of God gains wisdom by studying it and recieves patience in their affairs in exchange.

    <b> Phrase: Is there only one God in Kronology? </b>

    <br><br> The God of Kronology is called Aue and they are three who work together as one called Au, Ae, and Ay. This trio is an example of the working principle which states that God works through other entites to produce 'life' for God is one but uses tools to develop the universe which gives it purpose and intent. <br><br>

    There are many people who disagree with the idea that patience is required for a believer in religion, but I believe that patience is required because those who believe in God recognize his plan, and patience gives longevity, and this longevity gives life, and therefore time or 'motion' to produce events that are landmarks of one's existance.

    <b>Cipher: Why is one who studies patience a believer in Kronology? </b>

    <br><br>

    One of the first lessons of Kronology is patience because Kronologist believe that if one works through the cycles of ciphers and retrieves their souls from the hereafter (called River Styx) they will be able to move with evolution and therefore become apart of the world of immortality by persisting after it's study -- alive or dead.
