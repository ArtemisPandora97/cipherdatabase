<b> Cipher: How can Artemis benefit from having venues to restore his family fortune by restoring his father's business rather than engaging in criminal activity? </b>

<br><br>

The problem with Artemis Fowl not choosing to engage in criminal activity resides in the fact that he is extremely intelligent, and therefore venues of activity that stimulate his understanding of reality is required, especially when dealing with faries.

<br><br>

Objective: How is inheritance of knowledge an family apprenticeship, and why is it important for navigating human creativity?

<br><br>

<b> Cipher: How can Artemis benefit from having operations safeguarded by the government that allow paths to restoring his family fortune by rebuilding his father's business rather than engaging in criminal activity? </b>

<br><br>

One thought that comes to mind is the idea that Artemis wanted to find his father more than maintain the Fowl family name. [Intent]

    Objective: How can education become more personalized?

    <b> Cipher: How does government and education allow for our unique creativity to be developed by teaching people about themselves while still depending on the progress of learning -- true or false? </b>

    <br><br>

<b>Postulate: What is the relationship between our understanding of God/wisdom and our intelligence?</b>

    <br><br>

    Kronology believes that intelligence is derived from one's ability to apply wisdom to creation and therefore produce 'time' or 'motion'. 

    <br><br>

    Why do people who are intelligent recieve so much critiscm? An articulation that comes to mind is the idea that our intelligence gets us in trouble unless it is applied to the limiting factor of the surrounding intelligence. And when the intellectural thinks faster than their enviroment, friction occurs. 

    <br><br>

    Distinctions are an element of wisdom -- true or false? 

    <br><br>

    <b>Cipher: Why didn't Artemis make the world of Fairies known to the world at large? How is this important for understanding his motives for looking for them in the first place? When approching entities, it is important to remember 'intent' -- true or false? </b>

    <br><br>

    The ability to safeguard a secret is essential to starting any research for one does not know the depth of the secrets they will find.

    Artemis Fowl is an interesting book because it has a lot to do with the relationship between Artemis and other people. Artemis is a character that is hard to get to know because he is very intelligent and prefers to understand himself more than other people.

    <b> Cipher: How does one use intellect to gain self-awareness through other people? Is this wisdom -- why or why not? </b>

    <br><br> Develop an thought journal regarding one's desire to understand Artemis if you were apart of his life. What kind of character would you be, and how would you catalyst his destiny using your own self awareness?
