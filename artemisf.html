<b> Cipher: How can Artemis benefit from having venues to restore his family fortune by restoring his father's business rather than engaging in criminal activity? </b>

<br><br>

The problem with Artemis Fowl not choosing to engage in criminal activity resides in the fact that he is extremely intelligent, and therefore venues of activity that stimulate his understanding of reality is required, especially when dealing with faries.

<b>Postulate: What is the relationship between our understanding of God/wisdom and our intelligence?</b>

    <br><br>

    Kronology believes that intelligence is derived from one's ability to apply wisdom to creation and therefore produce 'time' or 'motion'. 

    <br><br>

    Why do people who are intelligent recieve so much critiscm? An articulation that comes to mind is the idea that our intelligence gets us in trouble unless it is applied to the limiting factor of the surrounding intelligence. And when the intellectural thinks faster than their enviroment, friction occurs. 

    <br><br>

    Distinctions are an element of wisdom -- true or false?
